            <h3>Cryptocurrency</h3>

            <h4><span class="smaller-bold">DogCoin (DOG)</span></h4>
            <p>DogCoin is an SPL token built on the Solana blockchain and serves as a global currency and investment vehicle.</p>

            <h5><span class="smaller-bold">Tokenomics:</span></h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Total Supply: 27,000,000,000,000</li>
                <li>Max Supply: 27,000,000,000,000</li>
                <li>Supply is capped at 27,000,000,000,000 coins</li>
            </ul>

            <h5><span class="smaller-bold">Token Distribution:</span></h5>
            <ul>
                <li>70% to original SOL/DOG liquidity pool on Raydium. Original coin price was set at 0.72 SOL for 18,900,000,000,000 coins. Original LP tokens were burned by the SOL Incinerator to protect the original coin price.</li>
                <li>20% to Marketing.</li>
                <li>10% to Founder.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>DogCoin aims to be a leading currency and investment vehicle globally, offering a safe haven for crypto investors through our commitment to product integrity and service excellence.</p>

            <p>DogCoin offers the fastest and least expensive transfers of any cryptocurrency or fiat currency. It serves as both a currency and investment and offers higher levels of potential gains and liquidity than any other investment including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, annuities, high interest savings accounts, and real estate. DogCoin is the safest and most superior investment currently available on the open market.</p>

            <p>April Investments' CEO Josh Zielinski bought about 91.4% of the DogCoin supply early on and pledges to never sell any of these coins. This will help to stabilize the price, reduce downward volatility, and keep the price moving onward and upward.</p>
